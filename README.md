## Main Features
- Collaborative Item Collection Game
  - Players path-find as a group to collect all items before time runs out
  - Time pressure + free movement introduce chaos as players make conflicting decisions
  - Majority-rules gameplay: On an interval, the most popular game command since the last tick is executed.
- Real-time Chat App
  - Recognizes game-related keywords
  - Only auto-scrolls when users are scrolled to the bottom of all messages
  - Supports anonymity via free renaming (though names must be unique)
  - Individuals can customize their chat color if unhappy with defaults
  - Inline emotes via chat keywords
